# Planetary Motion
### Planetary motion animation based on keplar's law of orbital motion

   ## Keplar's 3 laws of planetary motion 

  - The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
  - A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
  - The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the length of the semi-major axis of its orbit.

This is currently ongoing project so you are not able to find final result.

***Orbit Motion***
Orbital motion occurs whenever an object is moving forward and at the same time is pulled by gravity toward another object. ... The result is a circular or oval path called an orbit, in which one object keeps moving around the other. Because of the relatively great gravity of the sun, Earth orbits the sun.
