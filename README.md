### Planetary motion animation based on keplar's law of orbital motion

   ## Keplar's 3 laws of planetary motion 

  - The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
  - A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
  - The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the length of the semi-major axis of its orbit.

This is currently ongoing project so you are not able to find final result.

What are the 3 types of motion of the Earth?
The Earth turns (rotation around the polar axis), goes along on its orbit (revolution around the Sun), swings smoothly as un unbalanced spinning top (equinoctial precession).
