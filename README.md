# Planetary Motion
### Planetary motion animation based on keplar's law of orbital motion

   ## Keplar's 3 laws of planetary motion 

  - The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.</li>
  - A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.</li>
  - The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the length of the semi-major axis of its orbit.</li
