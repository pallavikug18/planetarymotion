# Planetary Motion
### Planetary motion animation based on keplar's law of orbital motion

   ## Keplar's 3 laws of planetary motion 

  - The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.
  - A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
  - The square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the length of the semi-major axis of its orbit.

This is currently ongoing project so you are not able to find final result.

***Revolution***
Earth revolves in orbit around the sun in 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes with reference to the stars, at a speed ranging from 29.29 to 30.29 km/s. The 6 hours, 9 minutes adds up to about an extra day every fourth year, which is designated a leap year, with the extra day added as February 29th.
